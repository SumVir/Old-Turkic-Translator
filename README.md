# Old-Turkic-Translator
***Hello, This is another Tkinter App I wrote with Python's Tkinter Library. The main purpose is to translate the user input into the Old Tengri language. 
To be sure, This is a letter-by-letter translator.***
<br>**IMPORTANT:<br>
After downloading ZIP of the repo,
In this places, you will need to paste path of BG music and BG image files in code to really enjoy the app.<br>
pygame.mixer.music.load(r"Paste here Altai.mp3 full file path as BG music") <br>
img = AutoResizingImage(canv, r"Paste GokTurkBGjpg.jpg full file path as BG image")**
